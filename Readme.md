# SMS Spam detection

Welcome to the assignment of sms spam detection.  
Its a type of learning assignment, the user just needs to open the notebook and run the cells reading the comments present.  
  
I encourage you to first have a look at Tensorflow Keras documentation - https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/sequential_model  

The main motive of this assignment is to give the user a overview about using deeplearning framework keras,
and how a machine learning task starts with raw data and then processed in required format then model training.  

By now you all have seen RNN notes provided in LMS, users are encourage to go through basic steps of keras deep learning framework.
While creating this assignment, it is assumed that user knows python well and have gone through above links.  

[NOTE:- While running the notebook , upload the "spam.csv" file in the proper location and change relavent locaion in notebook.
Fell free to comment or open a pull request, lets see what else you all can do with deep learning.

Happy coding geeks !
